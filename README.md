Season 3 Episode 1 of Netflix's hit show Black Mirror is called "Nosedive" and gives us a glimpse into a future where our ratings on social media controls our lives. The unnamed platform used for ratings is futistic, clean, and incredibly pastel. I loved the layout of it so much that I decided to attempt a css layout challenge using it as my end goal. Hope you enjoy!
